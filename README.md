# Blockchain_Evoting_System
A secure, transparent, and tamper-proof e-Voting web application built on blockchain technology — ensuring trust, anonymity, and verifiable election results.


🗳️ Blockchain-based e-Voting WebApp

A decentralized web application that enables secure, transparent, and anonymous electronic voting using blockchain technology. This project demonstrates how modern distributed ledger systems can eliminate election fraud, ensure vote integrity, and maintain voter privacy in a trustless environment.

🚀 Features

Decentralized Voting System – Built on Ethereum (or Hyperledger, etc.) smart contracts to prevent data tampering.

End-to-End Encryption – Ensures all votes are private and securely recorded.

Transparent Ledger – All transactions are verifiable by participants and observers.

Voter Authentication – Uses cryptographic IDs or digital wallets for secure user verification.

Real-time Tallying – Votes can be viewed and counted transparently without revealing identities.

Responsive Web Interface – Developed using modern web technologies (React.js / Next.js / Vue.js + Tailwind CSS).
